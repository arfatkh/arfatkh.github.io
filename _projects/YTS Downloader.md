Personal Project that searches YTS for movies and automatically downloades it along with subtitles 

Well In my defence I had ni Idea APIs existed back then.....
But Web Scrapper it is using multi processing to scrape all pages at once :)
And And And it was my first project in python so ... gimme a break


Cuz i thought its harder to just visit YTS.io

*Disclaimer : For the GenZ who tries to scrape sites ... It might not be legal . Take Permission ( meine ni li thi btw)*


No Piracy was supported in this project. YTS used for "Educational Purposes Only"


### Concepts used:

 

 - Web Scrapping  [BeautifulSoup4]
 - HTML Requests [requests.py]
 - Graphical User Interface [Using PyQt5 designer]
 - Multi-Threading (debatable ,I know in python its a myth but )[concurrent.futures]
 - Saving User Configuration [configparser] 
 -  Extracting Subtitles From Zipfiles :) 



### **In Action:**

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arfatkh/YTSDownloader/main/imgs/demo.gif)
