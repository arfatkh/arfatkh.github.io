<p>Personal Project that searches YTS for movies and automatically downloades it along with subtitles</p>

<p>Well In my defence I had ni Idea APIs existed back then…..
But Web Scrapper it is using multi processing to scrape all pages at once :)
And And And it was my first project in python so … gimme a break</p>

<p>Cuz i thought its harder to just visit YTS.io</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer : For the GenZ who tries to scrape sites … It might not be legal . Take Permission ( meine ni li thi btw)</em></p>

<p>No Piracy was supported in this project. YTS used for “Educational Purposes Only”</p>
