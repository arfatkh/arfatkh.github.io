                              <h3>About Me</h3>
                              <p>As a <b>computer science student at FAST Islamabad,</b> I've spent most of my time in front of a computer. I am deeply interested in API development and related technologies, with a strong focus on <b>low-level programming</b> and <b>back-end development</b>.</p>
                              <p>I've been coding for a while now and love to work on tech projects. I have developed my blogs and other personal projects, as well as worked as a web developer for REX MEDIA GROUP.</p>
                              <p>One of my favorite projects is a web scraper written in <b>Python</b> that scrapes and downloads movies from YTS.io. It's like having my own personal Netflix, but I don't have to share with anyone else!</p>
